Application is built using java,html,css3,and data stored in shared point.

<li>**webview:-**</li>
<br>
 &emsp;&emsp; Built using Html,css3,java,json,bootstrap, hosted in Azure web apps.

<li>**Backend:-**</li>
<br>
 &emsp;&emsp;Once the form is submitted data stored in cosmodb,Blob Container with help of powerflow, Powerautomate.
